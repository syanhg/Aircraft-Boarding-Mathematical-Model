# Boeing 737-800 Boarding Strategy Analysis

This document provides a detailed analysis of four different boarding strategies for a Boeing 737-800 aircraft with 114 passengers.

## Aircraft Specifications

- **Aircraft Model**: Boeing 737-800
- **Seating Arrangement**: 19 rows, 6 seats per row (3-3 configuration)
- **Total Seats**: 114
- **Aisle Width**: 0.51 meters
- **Aisle Length**: 39.5 meters
- **Typical Passenger Spacing**: 1 meter per passenger

## Boarding Strategies

### 1. Random Boarding

**Description**: Passengers board in random order without any specific sequence.

**Mechanism**:
- No predetermined boarding order
- Passengers select seats randomly
- High probability of interference between passengers

**Mathematical Model**:
- First-order differential equation: dN(t)/dt = -k·N(t)
- Reduced efficiency coefficient (k × 0.5) due to random boarding
- Higher congestion factor: C(t) = min(1, 2·α·|dN(t)/dt|)

**Boarding Time**:
- Theoretical: ~22 minutes
- Observed: ~22.0 minutes

### 2. Back-to-Front Boarding

**Description**: Aircraft divided into zones (from back to front), with each zone boarding sequentially.

**Mechanism**:
1. Dividing passengers into 6 zones (~19 passengers per zone)
2. Processing each zone sequentially (back to front)
3. Solving the differential equation for each zone's boarding period
4. Tracking the total remaining passengers at each time point

**Mathematical Model**:
- Piecewise differential equation for each zone i:
- dN_i(t)/dt = -k·N_i(t)·I_i(t)·(1-C_i(t))
- Where I_i(t) is an indicator function for zone i being active

**Boarding Time**:
- Theoretical: ~12 minutes
- Observed: ~20.5 minutes

### 3. Outside-In Boarding

**Description**: Passengers board based on seat position, with window seats first, followed by middle seats, and finally aisle seats.

**Mechanism**:
1. Processing window seats first (38 passengers)
2. Then middle seats (38 passengers)
3. Finally aisle seats (38 passengers)
4. Each seat type uses a different boarding efficiency based on interference levels

**Mathematical Model**:
- Piecewise differential equation for each seat type j:
- dN_j(t)/dt = -k·β_j·N_j(t)·(1-C_j(t))
- Where β_j is an efficiency factor based on seat type (window: 1.0, middle: 0.9, aisle: 0.8)

**Boarding Time**:
- Theoretical: ~10 minutes
- Observed: ~19.0 minutes

### 4. Hybrid Strategy (Proposed Optimised Strategy)

**Description**: Combines elements of both back-to-front and outside-in strategies. Passengers are divided into groups based on both row location and seat position.

**Boarding Sequence**:
1. Back window seats
2. Middle window seats
3. Front window seats
4. Back middle seats
5. Middle middle seats
6. Front middle seats
7. Back aisle seats
8. Middle aisle seats
9. Front aisle seats

**Mechanism**:
1. Dividing passengers into 9 distinct groups based on both row location and seat position (~13 passengers per group)
2. Processing groups in the specific sequence mentioned above
3. Implementing variable interference factors that combine both seat type and zone effects
4. Solving the differential equation for each group with its specific interference parameters
5. Tracking the total remaining passengers across the entire boarding process

**Mathematical Model**:
- Piecewise differential equation for each combination of zone i and seat type j:
- dN_ij(t)/dt = -k_ij·N_ij(t)·I_ij(t)·(1-C_ij(t))
- Where k_ij is the efficiency coefficient, I_ij(t) is an indicator function, and C_ij(t) is the congestion factor
- The congestion factor accounts for both row and seat interference:
- C_ij(t) = α_row·∑_k>i ∑_l N_kl(t) + α_seat·∑_l<j N_il(t)

**Boarding Time**:
- Theoretical: ~10 minutes
- Observed: ~16.5 minutes

## Comparative Analysis

### Theoretical vs. Observed Boarding Times

| Strategy | Theoretical Time (min) | Observed Time (min) | Difference (min) |
|----------|------------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Random | 22 | 22.0 | 0.0 |
| Back-to-Front | 12 | 20.5 | 8.5 |
| Outside-In | 10 | 19.0 | 9.0 |
| Hybrid | 10 | 16.5 | 6.5 |

### Percentage Improvements

| Strategy Comparison | Theoretical Improvement | Observed Improvement |
|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Hybrid vs. Random | 54.5% | 25.0% |
| Hybrid vs. Back-to-Front | 16.7% | 19.5% |
| Hybrid vs. Outside-In | 0.0% | 13.2% |

### Key Observations

1. **Gap Between Theory and Practice**:
   - Larger discrepancy for Back-to-Front and Outside-In strategies
   - Hybrid strategy shows smallest gap between theoretical and practical results
   - Random boarding matches theoretical prediction most closely

2. **Interference Factors**:
   - Row interference most significant in Back-to-Front
   - Seat interference most significant in Outside-In
   - Hybrid strategy addresses both simultaneously

3. **Congestion Patterns**:
   - Back-to-Front: High localized congestion in active boarding zone
   - Outside-In: Distributed congestion with seat interference
   - Hybrid: Minimal combined interference with predictable boarding sequence

## Conclusion

The hybrid strategy demonstrates superior performance in real-world conditions compared to other strategies. By systematically addressing both row-based congestion and seat interference, it achieves a 25.0% improvement over random boarding and a 19.5% improvement over the conventional back-to-front approach commonly used by airlines.

While the Outside-In strategy shows excellent theoretical performance, its real-world implementation is more challenging due to complexity in passenger organization. The hybrid strategy offers a better balance between theoretical efficiency and practical implementation.

Based on our simulation and mathematical modeling, the proposed hybrid strategy represents an optimal approach for boarding a Boeing 737-800 with 114 passengers, potentially saving approximately 5.5 minutes per flight compared to random boarding.
