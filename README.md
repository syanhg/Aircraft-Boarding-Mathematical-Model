# Aircraft Boarding Mathematical Model

This repository contains a mathematical analysis of passenger boarding processes in aircraft using differential equations. The paper explores how to optimize boarding strategies to minimize total boarding time.

## Overview

The study focuses on modeling passenger boarding dynamics for a Boeing 737-800 aircraft using first-order differential equations and numerical methods. By treating the passenger flow as a continuous fluid system, the model provides insights into how different boarding strategies affect overall efficiency.

## Key Components

- **Mathematical Framework**: Development of first-order differential equation models for aircraft boarding
- **Parameter Derivation**: Detailed derivation of efficiency coefficient (k) and congestion parameter (Î±)
- **Numerical Methods**: Implementation of Euler's method and Runge-Kutta methods for solving the differential equations
- **Boarding Strategies**: Analysis of traditional strategies (back-to-front, outside-in) and a proposed hybrid strategy
- **Comparative Analysis**: Quantitative comparison of different boarding strategies through simulation
- **Time Measurement System**: Proposal for a comprehensive system to measure and validate boarding time optimization

## Results

The analysis shows that the proposed hybrid strategy (combining elements of back-to-front and outside-in approaches) could potentially reduce boarding times by up to 54% compared to random boarding and by 16% compared to the traditional back-to-front strategy.
